At the moment my program can do the following things:

1) Navigate the game interface 
2) Open chests
3) Receive rewards from chests
4) Read elixir
5) Read deck during combat
6) Place cards at random, with the exception of a couple of cards for which logic is written
7) Get number of received crowns
8) Able to select game mode (global, mode_1, mode_2, 2X2)


In the future, do the following:

1) Read the deck and elixir of the opponent
2) Read units on the field
3) Receiving rewards from the pass royale
4) Switching between accounts
5) Playing in clan wars
6) Сard request
7) Dealing cards
8) Playing in events
9) Add a self-learning neural network to increase the level of the game
10) Multilanguage in the bot
